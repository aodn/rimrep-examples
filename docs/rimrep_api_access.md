# Using API to access RIMReP DMS datasets
![Screenshot of RIMReP DMS Pygeoapi home page highlighting in the red box where to access documentation](./images/pygeoapi.png)  
  
All datasets available through STAC are also available via Pygeoapi. The main difference between the two is that Pygeoapi provides API access to the datasets, while STAC provides a web-based interface to search for datasets. A list of all datasets can be found at [https://pygeoapi.staging.reefdata.io/collections](https://pygeoapi.staging.reefdata.io/collections).  
  
Full documentation about how to use the API can be found under the **API Definition** section of the Pygeoapi home page shown inside the red box in the image above. You can also click [here](https://pygeoapi.staging.reefdata.io/openapi?f=html) to access the documentation.
