## Description of example notebooks in repository
All notebooks described in this section are available in `R` and `Python`, you will find them in the `R_based_scripts` and the `Python_based_scripts` folders, respectively. 

- **AIMS temperature loggers**: Available as a [Quarto notebook](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/R_based_scripts/AIMS_waterTemp.md) for `R` users, and as a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/Python_based_scripts/AIMS_waterTemp.ipynb) for `Python` users. In this example, we will connect to the RIMReP geoparquet collection in our AWS S3 bucket to access the AIMS temperature logger dataset, which contains over 150 million records! We will calculate the mean latitude, longitude, and temperature, and total number of temperature records for all deployment sites around the Great Barrier Reef Marine Protected Area using familiar [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) verbs. Finally, we aggregated all data at a site level to create a map where the site marker change in size in proportion to the number of records at each site.  
- **Extracting water temperature at site**: Available as a [markdown notebook](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/R_based_scripts/Extracting_Water_Temperature_at_Site.md) for `R` users, and as a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/Python_based_scripts/Extracting_Water_Temperature_at_Site.ipynb) for `Python` users. This notebook calculates monthly temperature means for any sites of interest included in the AIMS Sea Surface Temperature Monitoring Program. Data summaries and plots saved in local machine.  
- **Extracting spatial data GBR**: Available as a [markdown notebook](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/R_based_scripts/Extracting_Spatial_Data_GBR_Features.md) for `R` users, and as a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/Python_based_scripts/Extracting_Spatial_Data_GBR_Features.ipynb) for `Python` users. This notebook extracts spatial data for all above water features within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Protected Area.  
- **Extracting water temperature within GBR feature boundaries**: Available as a [markdown notebook](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/R_based_scripts/Extracting_Water_Temperature_GBR_Features.md) and as a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/Python_based_scripts/Extracting_Water_Temperature_GBR_Features.ipynb): This notebook will identify AIMS water temperature monitoring sites within a GBR feature and calculate monthly means.  
- **Plotting ABS census data**: Available as a [markdown notebook](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/R_based_scripts/Plotting_ABS_Census_Data_LGA_2021.md) and as a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/Python_based_scripts/Plotting_ABS_Census_Data_LGA_2021.ipynb): This notebooks uses Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census data to create summary tables, bar plots and maps.  
- **Plotting SELTMP data**: Available as a [markdown notebook](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/R_based_scripts/Plotting_SELTMP_Data.md) and as a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/Python_based_scripts/Plotting_SELTMP_Data.ipynb): This notebooks uses the the Social and Economic Long-Term Monitoring Program (SELTMP) dataset from CSIRO to create a variety of plots available in their [dashboard](https://research.csiro.au/seltmp/explore-dashboards-here/).  
  
Additionally, there are two more notebooks available exclusively for `Python` users:  
- [**Geoparquet example (using AIMS Temperature Loggers data)**](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/Python_based_scripts/geoparquet.ipynb)  
- [**Zarr example (using NOAA Coral Reef Watch degree heating weeks data)**](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/Python_based_scripts/zarr.ipynb) 
And one notebook available exclusively for `R` users:
- [**NOAA Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) data**](https://github.com/lidefi87/rimrep-examples/blob/main/R_based_scripts/NOAA_Degree_Heating_Week.md). This notebooks gets the DHW gridded data from NOAA Coral Reef Watch via the RIMReP API and plots it. 
  
**Note:** You will notice that there are two files with the same name, but two different extensions: `.md` and `.Rmd`. They contain the same information, but in different formats. The `.Rmd` file is the source code of the notebook, which you can open in RStudio and run. While the `.md` file is the output of the `.Rmd` file and they include the results of running the code. If you click on the notebook links above, it will take you to the `.md` files, which are nicely formatted for GitHub.

## Description of scripts in repository
All scripts described in this section are available in `R` and `Python`, you will find them in the `R_based_scripts` and the `Python_based_scripts` folders, respectively. 
- **Useful Functions**: Available as an [`R` script](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/R_based_scripts/useful_functions.R) and in [`Python`](https://github.com/aodn/rimrep-examples/blob/main/Python_based_scripts/useful_spatial_functions_data_extraction.py). This script includes a collection of functions that we will use to extract data available in the RIMReP collections using spatial data, such as polygons defining boundaries for the area of our interest.
